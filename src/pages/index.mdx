# Hi people

## Welcome to your new Gatsby site.

### Testing Strange Things.

OK, for some reason if you have a list that is under an open menu, the menu will receive a mouseLeave event and close the menu when your mouse gets even with the list. That is so weird. It doesn't seem to matter if it's an ordered or unordered list, and lists are the only thing I've found so far that trigger this.  Maybe it's just in Firefox. Anyway, I'm just added some text here to push the list further down the screen to "fix" it.

- Now go build something great.
- here's another item.
